# WordPress Development Course Files

These are the files to accompany my [WordPress Development Course on Udemy](http://zacgordon.com/udemy).

Most of the examples are themes that you can install and active or open in your code editor to view.

Clone the repo and make changes on your own if you are following along with the course.
